## Summary

In short, dogs do see colour, but not in the same way humans do. Their colour vision is more limited, allowing them to see shades of blue and yellow, but not red and green.

## In Depth

While humans have three types of colour receptors in their eyes, known as cones, dogs only have two. This difference in cone types results in a more limited colour spectrum for dogs, often referred to as dichromatic vision.

The two types of cones in a dog's eyes are sensitive to blue and yellow wavelengths of light. As a result, dogs can see shades of blue, yellow, and grey, but they cannot distinguish between red and green. This means that when a dog looks at something that is red or green, it will appear as a shade of grey or a muddy brown.

This limited colour perception does not mean that dogs are at a disadvantage in their daily lives. In fact, their vision is adapted to help them in other ways. Dogs have more rod cells in their eyes, which are responsible for detecting light and motion. This means that dogs have better night vision and can detect movement more easily than humans.

In addition to their colour vision, dogs also have a wider field of view than humans due to the placement of their eyes. This allows them to better detect potential threats or prey in their environment.

So while your dog may not see the vibrant colours of a rainbow or appreciate the hues of a sunset like you do, their vision is perfectly suited to their needs as a species.
