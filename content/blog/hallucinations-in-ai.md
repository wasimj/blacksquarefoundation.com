Question: how can i search Google Tasks?

Response:
```
Here are a few ways to search your Google Tasks:

Open the Google Tasks website (https://tasks.google.com) in your web browser and sign into your Google account if needed. There is a search bar at the top that allows you to search your tasks by keywords, task names, etc.
In the Google Tasks mobile app, tap on the magnifying glass icon to open search. You can search through your task lists and tasks here.
If you use Gmail, you can search your tasks right from Gmail. Just go to Gmail and type your search terms into the search bar at the top. Make sure to click on "Tasks" in the left side filter to only search your tasks.
From within Google Calendar on the web, click on the Tasks icon on the left. This will open your tasks in a sidebar. Type into the search box at the top of the Tasks sidebar to search your tasks.
Use Google Search operators to search specifically within Google Tasks. For example: "deadline tomorrow" site:tasks.google.com will search for tasks in your Google Tasks with a deadline of tomorrow.
So in summary, the Google Tasks website, mobile apps, integration with Gmail, and Google Search operators allow you several ways to quickly search and find tasks you've created in Google Tasks. Let me know if you have any other questions!

None of which is correct!
