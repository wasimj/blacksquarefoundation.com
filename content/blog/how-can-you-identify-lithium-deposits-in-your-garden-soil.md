## Summary
Lithium deposits can be identified in garden soil by conducting a soil test and analyzing the results for the presence of lithium.

## In Depth
Lithium is a rare metal that is used in the production of batteries, ceramics, and glass. It is also used in the treatment of bipolar disorder and depression. Lithium deposits are found in certain types of rocks and minerals, and can also be present in soil.

To identify lithium deposits in garden soil, a soil test must be conducted. Soil tests can be purchased at garden centers or online, and typically involve taking a sample of soil from the garden and sending it to a laboratory for analysis.

The laboratory will analyze the soil sample for a variety of nutrients and minerals, including lithium. If lithium is present in the soil, the laboratory will provide a report indicating the concentration of lithium in the soil.

It is important to note that lithium deposits in garden soil are rare, and the concentration of lithium is typically very low. However, if you are interested in identifying lithium deposits in your garden soil, a soil test is the best way to do so.
