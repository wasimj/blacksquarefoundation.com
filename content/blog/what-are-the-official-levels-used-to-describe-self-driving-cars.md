## Summary

The official levels used to describe self-driving cars are defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and range from Level 0 to Level 5. These levels categorize vehicles based on the amount of human intervention required, with Level 0 being no automation and Level 5 being full automation.

## In Depth

The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has established a classification system for self-driving cars, which is widely accepted by the automotive industry and regulatory bodies. This system consists of six levels, ranging from Level 0 to Level 5, and is based on the degree of automation and the role of the human driver in the driving process.

1. **Level 0 - No Automation**: At this level, the human driver is in full control of the vehicle, and there is no automation. Any assistance systems, such as cruise control or parking sensors, are purely informational and do not control the vehicle.

2. **Level 1 - Driver Assistance**: This level includes vehicles with systems that can assist the driver in specific tasks, such as adaptive cruise control or lane-keeping assistance. However, the human driver is still responsible for controlling the vehicle and must be ready to take over at any time.

3. **Level 2 - Partial Automation**: At this level, the vehicle can control both steering and acceleration/deceleration in certain situations, such as highway driving. The human driver must still monitor the environment and be prepared to take control when needed.

4. **Level 3 - Conditional Automation**: Vehicles at this level can handle most driving tasks, but the human driver must be ready to take over when the system encounters a situation it cannot handle. The vehicle can make decisions like overtaking slower vehicles, but the driver must remain alert and be prepared to intervene.

5. **Level 4 - High Automation**: At this level, the vehicle can handle all driving tasks in specific conditions or environments, such as urban areas or highways. The human driver is not required to monitor the environment or be prepared to take over, but they can still intervene if desired.

6. **Level 5 - Full Automation**: This is the highest level of automation, where the vehicle can handle all driving tasks in all conditions and environments. There is no need for a human driver, and the vehicle can operate without any human intervention.

It is important to note that the transition from one level to another is not always clear-cut, and there may be some overlap between levels. Additionally, the development and deployment of self-driving cars are subject to regulatory approval and public acceptance, which may vary between countries and regions.
