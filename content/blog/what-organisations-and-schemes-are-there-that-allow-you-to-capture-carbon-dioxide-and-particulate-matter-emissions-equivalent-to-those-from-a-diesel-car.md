## Summary

In summary, there are several organisations and schemes available that allow you to capture carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions equivalent to those from a diesel car. Some of these include carbon offset programs, carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects, and air filtration technologies. By participating in these initiatives, individuals and businesses can help reduce their environmental impact and contribute to a cleaner, greener future.

## In Depth

### Carbon Offset Programs

Carbon offset programs are designed to help individuals and businesses compensate for their carbon emissions by investing in projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere. These projects can include renewable energy initiatives, reforestation efforts, and methane capture from landfills. By purchasing carbon offsets, you can support projects that capture or reduce an amount of CO2 equivalent to the emissions produced by a diesel car.

Some well-known carbon offset providers include:

1. **Gold Standard**: Founded by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and other international NGOs, Gold Standard offers a range of verified carbon offset projects, including renewable energy projects, reforestation efforts, and clean cookstove initiatives. (https://www.goldstandard.org/)

2. **TerraPass**: TerraPass provides carbon offsets from a variety of projects, including methane capture, renewable energy, and reforestation efforts. Their online calculator allows you to estimate your carbon footprint and purchase offsets accordingly. (https://www.terrapass.com/)

3. **Cool Effect**: Cool Effect is a non-profit organization that offers a selection of carbon offset projects, including renewable energy, reforestation, and methane capture initiatives. Their projects are rigorously vetted and verified to ensure effectiveness. (https://www.cooleffect.org/)

### Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Projects

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects are large-scale initiatives that aim to capture CO2 emissions from industrial processes and store them underground. By supporting or investing in these projects, you can help reduce the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere, potentially offsetting the emissions produced by a diesel car.

Some notable CCS projects include:

1. **Boundary Dam CCS Project**: Located in Saskatchewan, Canada, the Boundary Dam project is the world's first commercial-scale CCS project at a coal-fired power plant. The project captures around 1 million tonnes of CO2 per year, which is then used for enhanced oil recovery or stored underground.

2. **Gorgon CCS Project**: The Gorgon CCS project in Western Australia aims to capture and store CO2 emissions from natural gas processing. Once fully operational, the project is expected to capture up to 4 million tonnes of CO2 per year. (https://www.chevron.com/projects/gorgon)

### Air Filtration Technologies

Air filtration technologies can help capture particulate matter emissions, which are a significant component of air pollution from diesel cars. By implementing air filtration systems in urban areas or near busy roads, it is possible to reduce the concentration of particulate matter in the air.

Some examples of air filtration technologies include:

1. **CityTree**: Developed by Green City Solutions, the CityTree is a moss-covered vertical garden that acts as a natural air filter. Each CityTree can reportedly capture as much particulate matter as 275 urban trees, making it a potential solution for reducing emissions in densely populated areas. (https://greencitysolutions.de/en/)

2. **Smog Free Tower**: Designed by Dutch artist Daan Roosegaarde, the Smog Free Tower is a large outdoor air purifier that uses ionization technology to capture particulate matter. The tower has been installed in various cities, including Beijing and Rotterdam, to help improve local air quality. (https://www.studioroosegaarde.net/project/smog-free-project)
